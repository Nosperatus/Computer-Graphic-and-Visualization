How do I approach designing software:
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I liked using all the different header and source files together, and building on what we had implemented week over week. This helped me to reinforce these concepts and work with code that was well organized.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I would start by completing the assignments before each milestone, and leverage the code we worked with in each tutorial to help design my assignments.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I will definitely take the best practices for writing code and apply them to my projects in the future.

How do I approach developing programs:
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I worked with the OpenGL API which I had never used before. This required a lot of reading and researching before trying to apply what I learned. I learned to utilize the API documentation and work through challenges by using different resources available.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was constant throughout our course work. We started by drawing simple 2D shapes, then moved on to creating 3D ones. Next we worked on creating a camera and implemented user input to control it. We leanred how to texture the objects on top of that, and lastly got learn about adding lighting. It was nice to look back and reflect on each stage of the project, and see how all the iterations led to the final result.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I certainly had to go through a lot of trial and error to achieve the intended output. I would say that my approach to developing code evolved, as I got more and more comfortable working with the OpenGL API.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals:
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Working through this course and these projects helped strengthen my coding abilities in general. I will apply these same concepts in my future educational paths. I will also utilize what I learned as a hobby in the future, working on some game development in my spare time.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I can leverage these skills to create 2D/3D representations if ever required. The challenges and practice coding in general will help me as I continue advancing my career.
